DEPRECATED - I do not maintain that anymore. python-rrlog is still used as-it-is in some Python 2 websites, but it even won't make the transition to Python 3.

rrlog ist a pure Python logging library that supports instantly:


* log rotation
* remote logging (sockets)
* logging into textfiles or databases
* E-Mail notifications
* stackpath logging for comfortable debugging


A HTML manual for the latest version is at both:
